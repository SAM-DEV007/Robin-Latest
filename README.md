# Robin-Latest

It will be the last version of Robin AI Assistant. 

The Audio Model file is too big to upload here. So, it's in the link below:
[Audio Model](https://www.mediafire.com/file/stznlaajqtmps5q/Audio+Model.rar/file).

Replace the Audio Model folder with the downloaded one. To unzip, the downloaded `.rar` file, use [WinRaR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0).
Libraries must be installed.

For installing required dependencies, open cmd in this directory:
'pip install -r Requirements.txt'

PyAudio may give out error while installing wheel as they might be outdated. For that, install it manually via:
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio

And paste the wheel in the Scripts folder and install it via:
pip install <wheel name>

No need to read the LICENSE, if using for personal purposes and not for commercial use.
